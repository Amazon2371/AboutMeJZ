<h2>About Myself</h2>
<p style = "font-family:Arial; background-color:black"  ><dfn>My name</dfn> is <b><mark> JAYZEE JOEL TEVES</mark></b>. I transferred here, <b style = "color:Blue"><abbr title="University of Bohol">UB</abbr></b>, from <span style = "color:Green"><abbr title="University of San Carlos">USC</abbr></span>. It is very hard to study there due to a busy environment <ins>and heavy traffic early in the morning</ins> and I had to rent a room closeby to the University I studied in.</p>

<p style = "font-family:Arial; background-color:black"> I observed that studying in Bohol, in which it is my home province, would be easier due to the fact that I'm used to studying in the environment in Bohol. I chose this university since they still accept late enrollees and transferees. As of now, my <b style "color:Red">Transfer Credentials</b> have already been given to the Registrar's Office.</p>

<p style = "font-family:Arial; background-color:black">My life in the University? I'm <del>still</del> adjusting to the study environment of the University and have made some progress. It ain't a surprise since I'm <s>still</s> getting used to school life after a 1 semester break, and now I'm trying to pass the subjects that I re-enrolled. With that, I write this Narrative of mine.</p>

<p style = "font-family:Arial; background-color:black">They used to call me H<sub>2</sub>O, because I'm their water of life. They also used to call me chest<sup>2</sup> because of my fatty chest.</p>

<p style= "font-family:Arial; background-color:black"> I love the quote from my favorite  character:</p>
<blockquote style= "font-family:Arial; background-color:black">
<p><q>
What does it take to end a war? Well, if both sides wish for peace and set aside their hatred… No. Warfare is nothing but a <b><u>means of negotiation</u></b> between states. Wars break out even when there is no hatred. <u>Territory</u>, <u>resources</u>, or <u>interests</u> that you are determined to own. <u>Ideology</u>, <u>religion</u>, <u>pride</u>. <b><u>Wars are fought over those objectives all the time</u></b>. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end. That, or the war will end when the human cost <b><u>outweighs the gains</u></b>. Anger and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor. I’m not interested in those emotions. So I wouldn’t hate anyone just because they’re Martian.</q> <i>– Inaho Kaizuka</i></p>
